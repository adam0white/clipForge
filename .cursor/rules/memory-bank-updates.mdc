# Rule: Memory Bank Updates

## When to Update Memory Bank

Update the relevant Memory Bank files when:

1. **Major decisions are made**
   - Platform/tech stack chosen → `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`
   - Architecture patterns established → `systemPatterns.md`
   - Product direction chosen → `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`

2. **Significant progress occurs**
   - MVP features completed → `progress.md`
   - New features implemented → `progress.md`
   - Blockers resolved → `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`

3. **Context changes**
   - Work focus shifts → `activeContext.md`
   - New patterns discovered → `systemPatterns.md`
   - Dependencies added → `techContext.md`

4. **Session boundaries**
   - Before ending a work session → Update `activeContext.md` with next steps
   - After completing milestones → Update `progress.md`

## How to Update

**Keep It Minimal**:
- Only add information that's actually decided or implemented
- Remove speculation and "to be determined" items once decided
- Don't document every detail - focus on what's needed to resume work
- Prefer bullet points over paragraphs

**Update Atomically**:
- Update only the files that need changes
- Don't rewrite entire files for small updates
- Use the `search_replace` tool for targeted updates

**Trigger Phrases**:
When user says:
- "Update memory bank" → Review all files, update what's changed
- "What's our status?" → Check `progress.md` and `activeContext.md`
- "What have we decided?" → Check `activeContext.md` and `techContext.md`

## What NOT to Document

- Detailed how-to guides (use code comments instead)
- Every possible option (only document chosen approach)
- Exhaustive checklists before work starts
- Speculative future plans
- Information readily available in code

## File-Specific Guidelines

- `projectbrief.md`: Rarely changes - only update if core goals shift
- `productContext.md`: Rarely changes - update when product direction chosen
- `activeContext.md`: Updates frequently - current focus and next steps
- `systemPatterns.md`: Updates as patterns emerge - not before
- `techContext.md`: Updates when stack decisions made
- `progress.md`: Updates with each completed feature or milestone

**Golden Rule**: If you haven't built it or decided it yet, don't document it in detail.

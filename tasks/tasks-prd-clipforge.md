## Notes

- **MVP Deadline**: Tuesday, October 28th at 10:59 PM CT
- **Final Deadline**: Wednesday, October 29th at 10:59 PM CT
- **Philosophy**: Working state is sacred - test after each logical change, every commit should be deployable
- **Priority**: Stability over features - no crashes during core workflow
- **Testing Strategy**: Test after each phase, validate packaging early (end of Day 1), test on real Mac hardware
- **FFmpeg Integration**: Package FFmpeg binary with app, test encoding early, parse output for progress
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for simplicity, store edit decisions not modified files (non-destructive)
- **Error Handling**: Validate files before import, handle unsupported codecs gracefully, show user-friendly errors
- **Research**: Consult latest Electron/React/FFmpeg docs when implementing - platforms evolve rapidly
